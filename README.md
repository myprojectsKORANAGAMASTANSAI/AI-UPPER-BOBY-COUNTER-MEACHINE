1. **Project Overview**

The AI Upper Body Counter Machine project is designed to help track and monitor the number of 
individuals in a particular area using a live video feed or image snapshots. With the help of 
an AI model trained specifically for upper body detection, this system can provide real-time data
on crowd density or individual presence. The application is modular, allowing each component to be 
customized or extended as needed.

2. **System Architecture**

This project is based on a modular architecture with the following components:

Input Module: Captures input from cameras or other imaging sensors.

Pre-processing Unit: Applies image processing techniques to enhance detection accuracy.

Detection/Classification Model: Uses a trained AI model to detect upper bodies.

Counting Module: Implements logic to accurately count detected individuals.

Data Output Module: Outputs count data and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

3. **Features**

Real-Time Upper Body Detection: Processes video input in real-time to identify and count individuals.

Scalability: Easily adaptable to various environments by adjusting input sources and detection sensitivity.

Modular Design: Components can be customized or replaced independently.

Logging and Data Export: Logs count data for further analysis, with options to export in CSV format.

Flexible Output Options: Customize the display and data output to suit different monitoring needs.

4. **Installation**

Prerequisites
