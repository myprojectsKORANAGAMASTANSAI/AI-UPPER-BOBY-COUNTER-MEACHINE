Project Overview
The AI Upper Body Counter Machine project is designed to help track and monitor the number of 
individuals in a particular area using a live video feed or image snapshots. With the help of 
an AI model trained specifically for upper body detection, this system can provide real-time data
on crowd density or individual presence. The application is modular, allowing each component to be 
customized or extended as needed.

System Architecture
This project is based on a modular architecture with the following components:

Input Module: Captures input from cameras or other imaging sensors.

Pre-processing Unit: Applies image processing techniques to enhance detection accuracy.

Detection/Classification Model: Uses a trained AI model to detect upper bodies.

Counting Module: Implements logic to accurately count detected individuals.

Data Output Module: Outputs count data and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

Features
Real-Time Upper Body Detection: Processes video input in real-time to identify and count individuals.

Scalability: Easily adaptable to various environments by adjusting input sources and detection sensitivity.

Modular Design: Components can be customized or replaced independently.

Logging and Data Export: Logs count data for further analysis, with options to export in CSV format.

Flexible Output Options: Customize the display and data output to suit different monitoring needs.

Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following:

Python 3.8 or higher
Git
Steps
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/myprojectsKORANAGAMASTANSAI/AI-UPPER-BOBY-COUNTER-MEACHINE.git
